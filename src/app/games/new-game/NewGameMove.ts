  *   - `MoveCoord`: for moves that consist of selecting only a single space (e.g., dropping a piece on a board)
  *   - `MoveCoordToCoord`: for moves that consist of moving from one space to another
  *   - `MoveWithTwoCoords`: for moves that affect two spaces, but are not moves from one to the other.
  * All move must extends the `Move` parent class

     *   - `MoveCoord.getEncoder` and `MoveWithTwoCoords` to get an encoder for a move of the corresponding type.
     *   - `Encoder.tuple` to get an encoder for a move that has multiple fields
     *   - `Encoder.disjunction` to get an encoder for a move that may be of different types
