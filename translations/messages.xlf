        <source>At Dvonn, each hexagonal space contains a stack of pieces.
        If no number is indicated on a stack, it means that it only contains one piece.
        The number written on a stack indicates the number of pieces within that stack, hence the number of points its owner gets.
        The owner of a stack is the one that has a piece at the top of the stack.
        Only the owner of a stack can move it.
        A stack cannot be moved if it is surrounded by 6 other stacks.
        A stack is moved by as many spaces as there are pieces within, in a straight line, and it should land on an occupied space.
        This line cannot move along the vertex of two neighboring spaces, as would a vertical move.
        Therefore, there are six possible directions.
        The player with dark pieces starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        You&apos;re playing Dark, click on a stack and move it by one space.</source>

        <source>The game of Go is played on a board called a Goban, and the stones are placed on the intersections.
        The traditional board is made of 19x19 intersections, but on this website we have the 13x13 board.

Here, Dark has 9 territories on the left, and Light has 8 on the right. The top part belongs to no one. Each player&apos;s score at the end of the game is the sum of that player&apos;s territories and captures.</source>

        <source>In Go, suicide is forbidden.
        If putting a piece on an intersection removes the last liberty of your group and does not capture any stone, playing on that intersection would be a suicide and is therefore forbidden.

        From the capture rule, Dark can play inside Light&apos;s territory and make a capture.
        In this case, we say that Light has only one eye (its last liberty) and that Light is dead (even if not yet captured).
        At the end of the game, the dead stones will count as captures, and the intersections they occupy as territories.</source>

        This rule is called the Ko.

        <source>Finally, the spider can move exactly 3 spaces at a time. It is not allowed to go twice through the same space in a move. As the spider crawls around other pieces, it can only move around pieces that are in direct contact with it. This means that the spider is not allowed to temporarily split the hive. For example, here, Dark&apos;s spider cannot go on the left as its first move.

To do so, click on an empty space of the pressure plate of your choice for each capture. You can cancel this by clicking again on a piece you just put on a pressure plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&apos;re playing Dark.

        <source>Quarto is an alignment game. The goal is to align four pieces that have at least one common aspect:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;their color (light or dark),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;their size (big or small),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;their pattern (empty or dotted),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;their shape (round or square).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Here, we have a board with a victory by an alignment of dark pieces. Note that the pieces are not owned by any player.</source>

        <source>Every placement occurs in two steps: placing the piece you have in hand (in the small square) on a square of the board, and picking a piece that the opponent will have to place, by clicking on one of the pieces inside the dotted square. If you prefer, the order of these two steps can be reversed. Keep in mind that the second click confirms the move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Make a move.</source>

        <source>A game of Quarto can be configured to make it more complicated for one or both players.&lt;br/&gt;When you create a game and you want to change the original configuration, you can add a level to one or both players.

So, if the first player is weaker at this game, make the first player play at level two and the game will be more even and interesting.&lt;br/&gt;At level two, a player can win by grouping pieces with a common criterion on a 2x2 square.&lt;br/&gt;In this board, Light can win by making a square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&apos;re playing Light, win.</source>

        Afterwards, if the piece was neutral, it will become yours and takes your color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

        <source>To win at Trexo, you need to align 5 of your pieces. Only the piece on top counts, the hidden piece are no longer threats, and a victory can include pieces on differents heights.

        <source>Once the initial phase is done and all rings are on the board, you need to place markers on the board.
        To do so, put a marker in a ring by clicking on that ring.
        Then, the ring must be moved in a straight line, in any direction.
        A ring cannot pass through other rings during its move.
        If it goes over a group of markers, your move must stop at the first empty space after that group.
        All markers in the group are then flipped and their color change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

        <source>Finally, the last mechanic you need is to be able to get a ring from the board in order to gain points.
        To do so, you need to align 5 markers of your color.
        You can then get these markers by clicking on them, and then get one of your ring by clicking on it.
        You will then have one more point.
        You must capture when you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
